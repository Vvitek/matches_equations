Everyone do, but if you aren't familiar with this game let me explain it. There is invalid equation made by several matches. Your task is to pick one match and place it in another place to make this equation valid.  Sometimes it takes more time to solve it so why don't you want to use python to do it on your behalf?
## Getting Started
You just need to have python 2 or 3 installed on your machine
